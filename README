Using memoize
-------------

The memoize library can be used to quickly add the memoization feature to any 
existing function so that you can cache previously calculated results for the 
same arguments but don't have to "clutter" your function code with memoization 
specific code.

Installing
----------

python setup.py install

Running Built-In Tests
